The program prompts for a password, which is read into a buffer of 20 characters using puts.
Then the sha256 hash of that input is calculated (only the first 20 characters of the buffer are taken).
This hash is then compared to a stored hash of the correct password.
If this comparison holds, a local variable that was initialized to 0 is set to 1.
The program then prints either "You're root!" or "Wrong password", based on the value of that local variable (non-zero is root, zero is wrong).
